          <p class="leading-relaxed">Welcome to Part 2 of the Create Your Own JARVIS AI Series. In this tutorial, we will take the first real step toward building your own personal assistant by creating your very first Python file. This file will serve as the foundation of your project, and from here, we will continue to expand and improve your JARVIS in later parts of the series.

We will begin by setting up a new Python script and writing a basic structure that can interact with the tools we will use in the future. You will learn how to set up your development environment properly, save your file with the correct extension, and write a few simple lines of code that will allow the assistant to begin responding. Even if you are completely new to programming, this tutorial is designed to guide you step by step without confusion.

By the end of this session, you will have a working Python file that acts as the starting point for your AI assistant. Think of it as laying the first brick of your own JARVIS, which we will continue to build piece by piece in the upcoming lessons.</p>

          <p class="leading-relaxed">Welcome to Part 3 of the Create Your Own JARVIS AI Series. In this tutorial, we will be working on creating chatbot.py, which is the main chat engine for your JARVIS assistant. This script will be responsible for handling user input, sending it to the model, and returning meaningful responses. In other words, chatbot.py is the brain that allows your assistant to communicate.

We will begin by setting up the basic structure of the file. This includes importing the required libraries, connecting to the API, and defining the main function that manages the conversation. You will also learn how to pass prompts to the model and display the answers in a clean and user-friendly way. Along the way, we will go through each step carefully so that even if you are a beginner, you will be able to follow without difficulty.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a fully functional chatbot script that can interact with you through the terminal. Best of all, you will get access to the complete source code so that you can study, modify, and improve it according to your own ideas.</p>

          <p class="leading-relaxed"> Welcome to Part 4 of the Create Your Own JARVIS series. In this tutorial, we will focus on creating model.py, which will serve as the core chat engine for your JARVIS assistant. This is the file that brings your assistant to life by enabling it to process inputs and provide responses. We will go through the steps carefully so that you can follow along without confusion.

First, we will set up the required imports and make sure your API key is loaded securely. Then, we will create a function that allows the program to take input, generate a reply, and return it in a clear format. You will also learn how to include a simple memory feature so that the assistant can remember recent messages in a conversation. We will add a system prompt to guide the assistant's tone and style of answering.

Finally, we will test the script by running it directly from the terminal. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to type a message, send it to your model.py script, and see JARVIS respond like a real assistant.</p>

          <p class="leading-relaxed">Welcome to Part 5 of the JARVIS AI Series. In this tutorial, we will build the realtime-search-engine.py file step by step. This feature is an important upgrade for your JARVIS assistant because it will enable real-time access to information from the web. Instead of relying only on predefined data, your assistant will be able to look up fresh information whenever you need it.

We will begin by writing the basic structure of the file and importing the necessary libraries. Then, we will connect the script to a web search API and set up functions that can take a user query, send it to the internet, and return accurate results. You will also learn how to format these results so they can be displayed clearly by your assistant. The goal is to make the interaction smooth and useful in practical situations.

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a working real-time search engine integrated with your JARVIS assistant. This addition will make your project smarter, faster, and more powerful, bringing you one step closer to building a complete AI system.</p>
